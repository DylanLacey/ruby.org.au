# Ruby Australia Code of Conduct

## Matz is nice, so we are nice.

The Australian Ruby community is full of interesting, passionate and intelligent people from a diverse range of backgrounds. We want to ensure it remains a welcome and safe environment to anyone who wishes to be a part of it.

By being present at any Ruby Australia event, whether as an attendee, organiser, sponsor or speaker, you agree to follow this code of conduct:

The Ruby Australia organisation is dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any circumstance.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for events supported by Ruby Australia.

Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the event organisers.

If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact an organiser of the appropriate event, or member of the Ruby Australia committee.

Thank you for helping making this community welcoming and friendly for everyone.
